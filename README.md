# 2D-Inverse-Kinematics
This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to solve the inverse kinematics problem for fixed 2D robotic arms with two degrees of freedom (2-DoF). These functions are specifically designed to calculate joint angles that allow the robotic arm to reach a desired position. The typical application is for planar robotic manipulators that operate within a two-dimensional workspace.
